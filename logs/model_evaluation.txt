BUSINESS INTERPRETATION - random_forest
================================================================================

1. OVERALL PERFORMANCE
   The model achieves 55.41% accuracy in predicting
   booking cancellations, with an ROC-AUC score of 0.5660.

2. PRECISION (Positive Predictive Value)
   Precision: 54.34%
   When the model predicts a booking will be canceled,
   it is correct 54.34% of the time.
   Business Impact: Helps prioritize which bookings to focus retention
   efforts on, minimizing wasted resources on false alarms.

3. RECALL (Sensitivity)
   Recall: 26.61%
   The model correctly identifies 26.61% of all
   bookings that will actually be canceled.
   Business Impact: Indicates how many potential cancellations
   we can proactively address with interventions.

4. F1-SCORE (Harmonic Mean)
   F1-Score: 0.3572
   Balanced measure of precision and recall.
   ⚠ May need further tuning to improve balance.

5. ROC-AUC (Discriminative Power)
   ROC-AUC: 0.5660
   ⚠ Moderate discriminative ability - consider feature engineering.

6. BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
   • Use this model to score all new bookings for cancellation risk
   • Implement targeted retention strategies for high-risk bookings:
     - Send personalized confirmation emails
     - Offer flexible cancellation policies
     - Provide special incentives or upgrades
   • Monitor model performance monthly and retrain quarterly
   • A/B test interventions to measure actual impact on cancellation rates
